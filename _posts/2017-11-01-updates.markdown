# New Binary Available
It's taken me several months to scrounge up some time to do a tiny bit of development 
and thanks to a GitHub user named [guilhemc](https://github.com/guilhemc) reminding me about 
the issue periodically I was finally able to close out a couple of issues, 
discover a new issue, and patch that new issue as well.  There are still a couple quirks 
that I wish I could figure out, but those will be for another day/time.  These won't be noticable
to end users directly, but are annoyances that I'd like to do 
away with.

# Installation

```Stata
// Use this snippet to reinstall the JSONIO package for Stata
net inst jsonio, from(https://wbuchanan.github.io/StataJSON) replace 
```
