# New Binary Available
Thanks to Marc Kaulisch, I became aware that I hadn't updated the binary on the distribution branch in quite some time.  

After submitting an updated version of the program to the [SSC Archive](https://ideas.repec.org/s/boc/bocode.html) Kit Baum notified me of some errors in the `.ado` and `help jsonio` files.  These are now corrected as well.
